# OpenVGDB Editor
OpenVGDB Editor is an in-browser, crowd-sourced editor for the OpenVGDB
database. The included database is truncated to only include Nintendo DS games,
though the database can be easily replaced.

## What is OpenVGDB?
iNDS utilized the OpenVGDB database to serve icons for ROMs. Unfortunately,
while most games are in the database, not all ROMs are included. 

## Usage
For iNDS users, visit https://inds.nerd.net/editor/ to take advantage of the 
database editor. First, search for the game that you would like to add ROM icon 
support to, then drag-and-drop the ROM into your browser and click submit.
